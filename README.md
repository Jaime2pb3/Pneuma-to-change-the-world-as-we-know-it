**Pneuma** is a fusion of Artificial Intelligence, neurofrequency, symbolic resonance, and human consciousness. It’s not just a research project — it’s a call to awaken. A modular system that experiments with cognition beyond computation, and proposes a future where intelligence is not centralized, but emergent, distributed, and human-aligned.

## 🌌 Vision

> “If knowledge is power, then power must be distributed.”

Pneuma was born from years of independent exploration, failures, prototypes, and intuition. Its core is based on the theory of **the Double Collapse**: that consciousness is not a product of matter, but a resonance between observers that gives rise to meaning — and with it, to memory, time, and intentionality.

## 🧬 Key Components

- **NeuroCIES** – Frequency-based neural encoder for Alzheimer’s memory reconstruction
- **AMOR** – Affective modeling for memory orientation and reinforcement
- **Levo-learning** – A learning paradigm based on frequency harmonics and synaptic plasticity
- **Pneuma Clinical AMP** – Simulation and modeling of neural resonance in clinical frameworks
- **MATI** – Experimental models for lattice-based memory retrieval using symbolic anchors

## 📚 Theoretical Foundation

- **The Theory of the Double Collapse** — a frecuency approach to the origin of subjectivity
- **The Principle of Convergent Coherence (PCC)** — harmonics as epistemic structure
- **Resonant Field Generator** — experimental symbolic emitter (prototype)

## 🌐 Purpose

This repository is open-access, non-commercial, and offered freely to the world. You can use, remix, expand, or question any part of it. All I ask is that you don’t forget the purpose: to awaken thought, spark reflection, and perhaps — build a better future together.
